### Project Details
This is an update to the previous version of this site, [available here](https://github.com/MisterPeddler/Aloha-Apparel).  This update has added functions implemented using JavaScript and Jquery.  Layout was modified to replace all floats with flexbox.  This version features a nav menu and a new, responsive product category section.  Social icons are courtesy of Font Awesome and local font files were made web ready thanks to Font Squirrel.  

### Knowledge Gained
JavaScript, Jquery, flexbox and further best practices in web development and coding in general.  Implementing Jquery plugins such as flickity for the product carousel and a smooth scroll plugin written by Chris Ferdinandi (used here by virtue of the MIT license).  Vanilla javascript for email form validation and to provide the user feedback.  Also used JS to keep track of, and display, the number of items in a user's cart. Use of an autoprefixer package for Atom. The utter joy that is flexbox.
